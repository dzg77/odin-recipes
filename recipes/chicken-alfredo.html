    <h3 class="b-steps">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="b-steps">
        <li>Cook the fettuccine: Boil a large pot of salted water and cook the fettuccine according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken: While the pasta cooks, season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning (if using). Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken for 6-7 minutes per side, or until golden brown and fully cooked. Remove from the pan and let rest before slicing into strips.</li>
        <li>Make the Alfredo sauce: In the same skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and saut√© for 1 minute, until fragrant. Slowly pour in the heavy cream and whole milk, stirring constantly. Bring to a simmer and cook for 3-4 minutes to thicken slightly.</li>
        <li>Add the Parmesan: Lower the heat and stir in the grated Parmesan cheese. Continue to stir until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Combine pasta and sauce: Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce, tossing to coat the pasta evenly.</li>
        <li>Serve: Divide the pasta among plates, top with sliced chicken, and garnish with fresh parsley. Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
